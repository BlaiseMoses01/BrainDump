## ðŸ§© How I Plan to Use This

- Track daily and weekly progress via [Patch Notes](./PATCH_NOTES.md)
- Reference algorithms and notes across interviews and projects
- Write blog posts and create content using real study material and implementations.
- Reflect on growth over time, in public, to help market myself and build connections in my field
