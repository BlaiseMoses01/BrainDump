# ðŸ§  Patch Notes â€“ Road to 10x

Learning is incremental , just like software development. 
Follow along as I learn, refactor my knowledge, and ship better thinking.

### ðŸ“… July 12, 2025

#### Studied/Practiced
1. read Chapter 1 of *Design Patterns* and took notes on book's structure, key concepts , and diagram syntax
1. started building **PonyUp** , a poker sim/solver that I plan to incrementally build alongside my studies as a practical way to apply C++, systems design, algorithms, and probability
1. Did a deep dive into the Fisher-Yates shuffling algorithm and cpp's rng libraries , taking notes and coding some implmemetation examples.
#### Key Achievements/Takeaways
1.  Applied C++ fundamentals , enum logic , and class design to build Card and Deck representations for PonyUp
1. Learned and applied Fisher-Yates and randomization to implement shuffling logic for PonyUp using cpp `std::shuffle`, `std::mt19937`, and `std::random_device` 

#### Deliverables
1. Built Initial RoadTo10x repo 
2. Built Initial PonyUp repo
3. Added notes for Design Patterns Chapter 1,  Fisher Yates, and relevant cpp library methods
